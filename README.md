## Project Overview
Implement the classical Dining Philosophers Problem, where philosophers alternately think, eat, and sleep around a table with shared forks. This simulates synchronization, resource contention, and deadlock prevention.

Imagine N philosophers sitting around a circular table. Each philosopher has:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A plate of spaghetti
A fork to their left and fork to their right
They must:

* Think for a while
* Pick up two forks (left and right) to eat
* Eat for a while
* Sleep for a while
* Repeat...

## Objective
- Practice multithreading (or multiprocessing in bonus stages).
- Ensure correct synchronization using mutexes, semaphores, or shared memory.
- Prevent deadlocks, resource starvation, and race conditions.
