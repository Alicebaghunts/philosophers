## Project Overview
Implement the classical Dining Philosophers Problem, where philosophers alternately think, eat, and sleep around a table with shared forks. This simulates synchronization, resource contention, and deadlock prevention.

## ---Objective---
Practice multithreading (or multiprocessing in bonus stages).
Ensure correct synchronization using mutexes, semaphores, or shared memory.
Prevent deadlocks, resource starvation, and race conditions.
Achieve project norms: functions ≤ 25 lines, variables declared at function top, only allowed functions used.
